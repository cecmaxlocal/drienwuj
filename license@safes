License requirements for safes, specifically safe deposit boxes, vary by region and are generally designed to ensure security, proper management, and regulatory compliance.

Key points on license and regulation for safe deposit box services:

- Businesses offering safe deposit or safe custody services usually must register with financial regulatory authorities, such as the FCA in the UK or equivalent bodies elsewhere, and comply with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regulations.[1]
- Licensing often includes maintaining secure facilities that meet physical and procedural standards, including vault specifications, controlled access, and documented identification of individuals accessing the boxes.[4][6]
- Customers accessing safe deposit boxes must be registered licensees, with rights to access documented and monitored; unauthorized access is restricted, and access logs or signatures are typically maintained.[2][6]
- Financial institutions renting safe deposit boxes issue licenses that define the relationship as a license to use the box for storage, not as a landlord-tenant or trustee relationship, thereby limiting liability for the box contents.[4]
- Operating a safe deposit business requires adherence to statutory requirements including corporate surety bonds, licensing publications, and facility standards.[5][9]

In summary, licensing safes like safe deposit boxes is a regulated activity ensuring secure storage, identity verification, legal compliance, and limited liability for custodians managing these facilities.[6][9][1][5][4]
